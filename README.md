# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
The hand recognition gesture project is a computer vision-based project designed to accurately interpret hand gestures. The system can analyze input and identify various hand gestures like the fist, five, rad, peace, and many more. The project aims to develop a robust and efficient hand gesture recognition model that can recognize a diverse set of gestures with high accuracy and low latency by leveraging the power of the model used.

The "Pre-Processing and User Input.ipynb" file is the main file that needs to be run in order for the project to work.
The "User-input" folder contains some of the example test data images.
